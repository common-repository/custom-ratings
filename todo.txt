- look over phpdocs syntax
- color selector text
- move 'adding your vote' text to space above report text
- wrap buttons in p tag for consistent spacing between elements
- mobile solution to multiple lines of icons

TESTING

ROAD MAP
- have separate error text field for 'getting vote data' and 'adding vote'
-voting for  comments
-notice that if using WPML and no root post, wonâ€™t display ratings
-loop ajax calls if error/fail
-account for dynamically added posts/excerpts
-only show rating if above 3
-account for different language display of decimal numbers
-before releasing public github link, remove initial commits with init code bas
-admin post listing with filter for rating, with icons
-styling options for box
-separate settings page into tabs
-option to apply only to main query object
-option to hide all css styles, give option to add own css adjustments
